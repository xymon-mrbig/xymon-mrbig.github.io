# Upgrade

Do this to upgrade Mr Big to the latest version:

1. Get the latest zip archive in the usual place
1. Stop the MrBig service by typing "net stop mrbig"
1. Copy the new mrbig.exe on top of the old one
1. Start the service by typing "net start mrbig" 

The service can of course be stopped and started using the GUI that comes with Windows.

The procedure to upgrade from Quest's client is described under [installation.](install.md)
